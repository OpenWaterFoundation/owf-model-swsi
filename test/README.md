# test-months #

This folder contains subfolders that are used to test the SWSI analysis in the repository files
(rather than installing the files outside the repository files).
Copy the `workflow` files to a folder named `YYYY-MM` for the analysis month being run.

The files can be manually copied, or run the `build-util/copy-workflow-to-test.bash` script.

All files in a monthly folder are ignored from the repository except for this `README.md` file.
