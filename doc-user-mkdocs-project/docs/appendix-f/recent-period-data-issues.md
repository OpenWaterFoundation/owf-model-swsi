# Appendix F / Recent Period Data Issues #

During the development of the Colorado SWSI Automation Tool,
the recent period data were reviewed by OWF and the issues are documented herein along with the implemented solutions.
Unresolved issues are noted using red text.

*   To avoid a burden being placed on DWR to fill a large number of missing values in the recent period,
    OWF implemented automated filling for the natural flows and the reservoir storage data through the end of the recent period.
    If desired, DWR can supply manual overrides to fill data in the recent period (see Table 14 in
    [Appendix E](../appendix-e/current-water-year-data-issues.md)).
