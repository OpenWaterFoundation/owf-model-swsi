# Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) #

This is the documentation for the Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) model,
which consists of a main configuration Excel workbook,
workflow as TSTool command files, and other files.

The model is used to compute a monthly index of surface water supply conditions using snowpack, reservoir storage,
and streamflow forecast.

This documentation has been updated for SWSI version 2.0.0.

The initial documentation is an online version of the State of Colorado SWSI documenation
and will evolve as the SWSI tool is updated for general application.

The original [Excel-based SWSI analysis](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/id/snow/waterproducts/?cid=STELPRDB1240821)
was created by the
Natural Resources Conservation Service.

The State of Colorado provided funding to automate the NRCS SWSI process using TSTool software,
resulting in the initial SWSI tool described in this documentation.
See the [State of Colorado SWSI Tool](https://dwr.colorado.gov/services/water-administration/drought-and-swsi).

Additional enhancements to the SWSI tool have been implemented by the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](https://openwaterfoundation.org)
with funding from the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/).
