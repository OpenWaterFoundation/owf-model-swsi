## Overview ##

This dataset contains files associated with the Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) analysis,
which estimates water supply conditions for river basins.
The files are generated using the
[SWSI Model](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-model-swsi) using TSTool software.

## Workflow ##

See the [`owf-model-swsi`](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-data-us-huc-basins)
GitHub repository for information.

## Update Frequency and Versions ##

The dataset is typically updated each month with the model being run
in the first few days after the start of the month.
A separate dataset folder is available for each month, consisting of many files for each month.

## Credits ##

* The original Excel spreadsheet-based model was created by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
* The Open Water Foundation subsequently created an automated tool based on TSTool software,
  which is used by the Colorado Division of Water Resource.
* The latest iteration is a general tool that is being implemented for the
  Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy in order to provide hydrologic water supply indicators.
